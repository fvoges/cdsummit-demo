Simple Puppet Enterprise demo

Requires:
* Vagrant
* Vagrant Fusion plugin
* Vagrant Hostmanager plugin
* VMware Fusion

Changing the Vagrant file to use VirtualBox should be easy. I just happen to prefer Fusion.

This setup has a Puppet Master and one node managed by the master.

During provisioning, the master will run a script to pull a set of manifests into /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/environments/production. The script will also setup hiera.


The manifests installed use the following modules from the Forge (installed using puppet module install):
 * puppetlabs-ntp
 * puppetlabs-vcsrepo
 * jfryman-nginx

It also installs roles, profiles and an "app" module. The agent node is classified with a static web site. The content for the site is retrieved form github using vcsrepo from the "app" module.
